        Acknowledge Your Feelings: It is okay to feel sad. Recognize that
        sadness is a natural emotion and an important signal that you might need
        some self-care or a change in perspective. Allow Yourself Time:
        Sometimes, you simply need time to process your emotions. Accepting that
        it’s normal to have down days can lessen the pressure to “be okay”
        immediately.
